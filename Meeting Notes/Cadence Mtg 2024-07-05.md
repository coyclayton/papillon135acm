## Discussion
- Reconfirmed that Employee and Crew are NOT Ticket Types because they are NOT mutually exclusive with NRPS and Non Rev Space A
- The updated payment summary is only partially functional
	- if you delete and element then its deleted from the summary table and this is not right
	- this should be more of a "transaction history" that shows things getting added and remove as it relates to its 
- Core truth,  the limitation on the scope of the amounts must always be in direction relation between the balance of "charge" and "payment".
- Need to find workflow to allow for passengers to be manipulated onto another flight without affecting the reservations core data.  Also to insure that the data cannot change after its been manifested.
- Need a method that sends the value of a reservation to a credit voucher.
