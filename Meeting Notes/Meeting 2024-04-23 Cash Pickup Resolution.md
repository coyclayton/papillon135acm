	- REWORK: Once a "Cash Pickup" item is attached to an invoice number (batch) then it must not be able to be assigned to any other batch.
		- There must be a way to "unassign" a Cash Pickup payment. 
		- Need a search interface to find "Payment Batches"
		- Add interface to find and work with Batches
			- Front counter agent will open interface to receive a Batch, provide the batch number.  Batch is marked as complete.
			- If amount received is NOT what is expected in the batch then ALERT and flag batch as "Partial Paid Batches".
			- Need a way to move from partial to complete.
- Payment Ledger Table
	- Needs a thorough user interface QA Scrub
