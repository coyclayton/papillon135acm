## Review and Discussion
- Ticket Types
- Booking Flow Issues
	- Payment & Refunds
		- Refund process does not pull correct amount
		- Payment transaction summary not totaling correctly after a refund action
		- Adding and refunding items is pretty broken and unreliable
		- "Res Value" column is not being calculated
	- Reservation Updates
		- Unable to see the change in both price and action.
		- Create a "are you sure" box after the selection is made during the update reservation (Booking Change Search)
			- Displays the summary of changes
			- Allow user to back out and NOT commit the change
	- Cancellation Process
		- Make a note under the amount field that displays a notice
