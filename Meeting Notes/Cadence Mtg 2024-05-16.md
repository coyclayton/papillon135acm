## Review & Rework
- Universal
	- Inventory summary line quantities are currently broken
	- Change working date to Lime Green
	- Working with Context
		- Base needs to be very obvious
		- Selecting a date on 1 tab needs to change the date context on all others
		- Selecting a base on 1 tab needs to change the base context on all others
- Check In Process
	- Tags are currently broken
- Payment Process
	- Remove "hold", nobody knows why its there.
	- Still need to be able to transfer payments from 1 reservation to another as a payment type.
	- If we're going to "hold" a reservation. 
- Day Pax View
	- Asset type filter per tab is not yet implemented.

## Suggested Functionality
- Resurfaced Meta Data with Tags as you could tag a reservation with a bit of meta data to define how long to hold the reservation before releasing it.
